## Quickstart > Inference

This folder contains scripts to get you started with inference on Meta Llama models.

* [Code Llama](./code_llama/) contains scripts for tasks relating to code generation using CodeLlama
* [Local Inference](./local_inference/) contains scripts to do memory efficient inference on servers and local machines
* [Mobile Inference](./mobile_inference/) has scripts using MLC to serve Llama on Android (h/t to OctoAI for the contribution!)
* [Model Update Example](./modelUpgradeExample.py) shows an example of replacing a Llama 3 model with a Llama 3.1 model.
