## Overview

The GraphRAG visualization project include two phases: graphrag and visualization. 

To learn more about GraphRAG and how it can be used to enhance your LLMs ability to reason about your private data, please visit the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Blog Post.</a>

For knowledge graph visualization, the entities information are extracted from Phase 2, Graph Tables.

The demo folder include results of running multiple text files(mutitxt) and one single file(ragtest)

## Quickstart
Step1 : Extracting entities and connections, please visit the <a href= "https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/posts/get_started/">How to run.</a>

Step 2: Visualization 
1. update file (output) path
2. feature examples: 
 * [Pause / Resume animation]ï¼š rotate_test.ipynb
 * [Text as nodes]

## Prompt Tuning

Using _GraphRAG_ with your data out of the box may not yield the best possible results.
We strongly recommend to fine-tune your prompts following the [Prompt Tuning Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/posts/prompt_tuning/overview/) in our documentation.
