{"result": "The concepts of \"INTERNAL CONSISTENCY\" and \"SELF-FEEDBACK\" are closely interconnected, with Self-Feedback designed to enhance Internal Consistency in model responses. Self-Feedback operates within the framework of Internal Consistency, leveraging its principles to improve the performance of reasoning models. It is proposed as a framework that integrates the perspective of Internal Consistency, thereby aiming to bolster the overall coherence and reliability of model outputs. This relationship underscores the importance of Internal Consistency in the development and refinement of Self-Feedback mechanisms.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
