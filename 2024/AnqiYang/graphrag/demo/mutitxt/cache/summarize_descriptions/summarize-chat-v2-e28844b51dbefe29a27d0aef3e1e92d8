{"result": "External Feedback is a process that involves utilizing external sources to improve the performance of language models. This includes feedback from other models, error messages, and additional input or corrections provided to the models. The primary aim of External Feedback is to enhance the quality of outputs, particularly in contexts such as code generation. By incorporating these external feedback mechanisms, the performance of language models can be significantly improved.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
