{"result": "\"Self-Correct\" is a framework designed to enhance the accuracy of language model outputs by employing iterative feedback mechanisms. This framework includes the training of a dedicated Corrector model, which is specifically aimed at generating improved feedback for the language model. However, this specialized training may lead to a reduction in flexibility, as the Corrector model becomes tailored to specific tasks.
