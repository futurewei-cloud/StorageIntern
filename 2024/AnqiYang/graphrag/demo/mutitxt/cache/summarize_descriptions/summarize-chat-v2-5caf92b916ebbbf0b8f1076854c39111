{"result": "\"Explicit Reasoning\" involves generating a sequence of tokens to solve complex problems, thereby enhancing the capabilities of language models. It refers specifically to reasoning conducted using multiple tokens in language, exemplified by methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning.
