{"result": "DEPICT is an approach that contrasts with Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) by encompassing a broader range of models, including those that are not classified as CBM. Despite this distinction, DEPICT is related to Concept Bottleneck Models in that both methodologies aim to enhance the understanding of model behavior and performance through the lens of concepts. This dual focus allows DEPICT to leverage insights from CBM while also expanding its applicability to a wider array of modeling techniques.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
