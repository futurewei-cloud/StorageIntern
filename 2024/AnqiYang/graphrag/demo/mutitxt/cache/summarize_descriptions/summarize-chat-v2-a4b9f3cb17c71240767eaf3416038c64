{"result": "Soft Self-Consistency (Soft SC) is an organization that introduces an adaptive scoring function designed to calculate the joint probability of tokens in a response. This approach is a variant of the Self-Consistency method, specifically focusing on evaluating responses in language models by calculating the joint probability of tokens for each response as a scoring function. Through this innovative methodology, Soft Self-Consistency aims to enhance the evaluation process of language model outputs.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
