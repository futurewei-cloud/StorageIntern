When generating a sentence, EVER verifies the accuracy of the generated sentence\neither by the LLM itself or retrieved external information, generating feedback to modify the sentence if there are issues. The\nmodified sentence is then re-appended into the generated text\niteratively. Similarly, PURR (Petite Unsupervised Research\nand Revision) [101] and RARR (Retrofit Attribution using\nResearch and Revision) [102] follow a similar approach as\nEVER, where the verification stage relies on retrieving external\nknowledge to provide modification feedback.\nIn contrast to EVER, FAVA (FAct Vericaton with Augmentation) [54] adopts a more sophisticated approach. It finetunes the model to generate tokens that edit its own content,\nsignificantly enhancing editing efficiency. Their fine-tuning\ndataset includes examples like: \u201cMessi is an <entity><delete\n>Argentine </delete ><mark >Brazilian </mark ></entity\n>soccer player.\u201d Special tokens enclosed in angle brackets\nare also trained to be generated, effectively eliminating hallucinations through rendering. The major advantage of this\nmethod lies in granting the LLM maximum autonomy to make\nmistakes and subsequently correct them freely. Moreover, this\napproach bears resemblance to Quiet-STaR [82] mentioned in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
