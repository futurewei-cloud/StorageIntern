During training, images were reshaped such that their smaller axis\nwas 256 pixels, and then randomly cropped along their longer axis to 256x256.\nImages were also randomly rotated up to 15 degrees.

If the target\nmodel performs well on generated images, then we can measure concept classifier\nperformance on specific concepts in the images that we wish to permute. For\nconcepts that we are not permuting, we might not need to validate effective\ngeneration depending on the scenario: (1) Target model does not pass the checks\nof effective generation. Consider a concept that we are not permuting in text\nspace (e.g., Pleural effusion on the chest X-ray). If the target model performance\ndrops on the generated images, then we might want to investigate why. In this\nsetting, it would be useful to look at granular changes in model performance via\nthe concept classifier to know if specific concepts are not being generated well,\nand thus contributing to poor target model performance.
