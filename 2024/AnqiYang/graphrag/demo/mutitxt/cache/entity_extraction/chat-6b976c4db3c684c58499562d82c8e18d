Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Again, consider\na concept that we are not permuting in text space (e.g., Pleural effusion on\nthe chest X-ray). If the target model passes the checks of effective generation,\nbut the concept classifier performs poorly in detecting a specific concept that\nwe are not permuting, we can still apply DEPICT. This is because we know\nthe model must not be relying on the non-permutable concept, since the target\nmodel can still classify the generated images well. Furthermore, we do not need\nto generate a reference performance for the non-permutable concept since we are\nnot permuting it, nor ranking it against other concepts.\nIndependent permutation.
