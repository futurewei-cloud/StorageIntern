Reflexion relies on external\ngolden truth as a stopping condition for iterative refining\nduring self-correction, which is an unreasonable setup\u2014if\nthere is already a golden truth, there is no need for predictions.\nFor Multi-Agent Debate, the authors\u2019 experiments found that\nthis method is significantly inferior to the Self-Consistency\nstrategy and consumes substantial memory. For Self-Refine,\nthe authors found that the prompts used for initial results and\nrefining were unfair, and they generated a fairer prompt that\nproduced better responses in one go.\nDue to the different characteristics of various works, Kamoi\net al. [24] provide a more comprehensive analysis by constructing a clear classification method and systematically comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each types of work.\nThey suggest that the ability to self-correct should be discussed\naccording to the specific task. For example, for tasks with\ndecomposable responses18 or verifiable tasks19 , it is feasible\nfor the model to optimize itself.\nAlthough the survey [24] provides more meaningful viewpoints through classified discussions, it complicates the field,\nmaking it difficult to form a systematic framework.
