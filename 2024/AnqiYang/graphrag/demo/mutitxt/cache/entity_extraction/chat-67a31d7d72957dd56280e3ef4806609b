LLMUncertainty-Bench [129] extracts five test tasks (including\nquestion answering, reading comprehension, commonsense\ninference, dialogue response selection, and document\nsummarization) from common benchmark datasets and uses\nconformal prediction techniques to construct benchmarks.\nUBench [130] also extracts data from other datasets,\ntotaling 3978 multiple-choice questions covering knowledge,\nlanguage, understanding, and reasoning abilities.

This line of\nwork centers on assessing whether a model delivers consistent responses to queries that are semantically equivalent\nbut phrased differently. The key focus is on developing a\nvariety of synonymous queries to test the model\u2019s reliability.\nFor instance, the ConsisEval Benchmark [131] creates simpler\nsynonymous queries for each question. PopQA-TP [132] and\nParaRel [133] construct synonymous queries through rephrasing. BMLAMA [134] focuses on multilingual consistency,\nconstructing a parallel corpus of queries.
