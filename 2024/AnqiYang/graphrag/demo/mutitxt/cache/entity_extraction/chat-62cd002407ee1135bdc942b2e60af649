However, since the synthetic data generated by LLMs cannot be perfect, sometimes\nincorrect data can be introduced into the dataset and may not be filtered out by our filtering process.\nThese data can result in misalignments and incorrect mappings during pre-training and fine-tuning,\npotentially leading to incorrect responses and hallucinations. Thus, the performance of our chart\nMLLMs is limited by the LLMs\u2019 generation capabilities. We can potentially include more advanced\nLLMs in the data generation pipeline to reduce the occurrence of incorrect data. Moreover, another\nlimitation of our model is that it currently supports understanding only 18 chart types. However,\nthere are many more chart types in the real world.
