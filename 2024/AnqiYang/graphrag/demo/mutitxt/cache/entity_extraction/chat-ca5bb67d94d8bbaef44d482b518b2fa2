While the concept classifier is used to ensure that the concept of interest\nhas been indeed permuted, this still limits the applicability of DEPICT. Moving forward, DEPICT\u2019s success relies on good generative models that can map\npermuted concepts in the text space to the image space effectively.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the reason behind AI model predictions can aid the safe deployment of AI. To date, image-based model explanations have been limited to\ninstance-based explanations the pixel space [28, 32], which are difficult to interpret [1, 2, 12]. Instead, DEPICT generates image-based explanations at the\ndataset-level in the concept space. While directly permuting concepts in pixel\nspace is difficult, DEPICT permutes concepts in the text space and then generates new images reflecting the permutations via text-conditioned diffusion.\nDEPICT relies on a text-conditioned diffusion model that effectively generates\nimages and independently permutes concepts across images. While we have included checks to verify these assumptions, we cannot guarantee that such a\ndiffusion model is available. However, given the rapid progress of the field, we\nexpect that the availability or the ability to train such models will improve, increasing the feasibility of DE\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
