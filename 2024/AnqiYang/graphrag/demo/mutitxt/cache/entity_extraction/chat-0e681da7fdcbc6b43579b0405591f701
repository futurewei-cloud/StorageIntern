TruthX [7] explored a more efficient intervention\nstrategy. It targets not only attention heads but also latent states\nin the forward feedback layer. Mapping these states separately\nusing truthful and semantic encoders significantly reduces the\nimpact on the language model\u2019s overall performance while\nenhancing representations of truthfulness.\nBesides improving truthfulness, what other characteristics\ndo latent layers possess? Recently, more work has begun\nto explore various features within latent layers. This not\nonly demystifies model black boxes but also offers potential methods to mitigate hallucination issues. For example,\nWu et al. [107] discovered that some attention heads focus\nmore on long-context retrieval capabilities (strong copy-paste\nneedle abilities). In tests like Needle-in-a-Haystack, blocking\nthese attention heads results in performance dropping from\n94.7% to 63.6%. Can enhancing model retrieval heads reduce\nhallucinations in long contexts? This is a question worth\nexploring. For another example, teams from Anthropic also\nused dictionary learning to discover monosemanticity within\nLLMs [108], such as \u201cGolden Gate Bridge.\u201d Activating states\ncorresponding to the \u201cGolden Gate Bridge\u201d in latent layers\nleads the model to consider itself as the bridge. OpenAI also\nproposed Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) [109] to automatically\nidentify latent features within language models.\nIf feature\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
