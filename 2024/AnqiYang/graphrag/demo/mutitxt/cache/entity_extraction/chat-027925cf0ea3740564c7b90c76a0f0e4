To generate model feature importances with DEPICT, we\npermute each concept in the text-space 25 times. For each permutation, we generate a dataset with the diffusion model and pass these images through the target\nmodel. The AUROC drop compared to the dataset generated with non-permuted\ntext yields a distribution of model feature importance values per concept.\nOracle model feature ranking. We again calculate standardized regression\ncoefficients using the learned weight vector w. We also calculate an additional\noracle by permuting concepts at the bottleneck in the supplementary.\nBaselines. We compare DEPICT to GradCAM [32] and LIME [28]. We measure\nthe IOU between the GradCAM and LIME masks using each object annotation\nmask for each image in COCO (full details are in supplementary 9).\nEvaluation & Results. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate DEPICT\non COCO just as we did in the synthetic setting, as well as validate the assumptions of effective generation and independent permutation using a concept\nclassifier trained to predict the concepts in COCO (full details in supplementary\n9).
