For simplicity we focus on binary\nclassification, although permutation importance generalizes to multi-class classification and even regression. We assume: an input space T (e.g., Rd for ddimensional numerical tabular data); a classifier f : T \u2192 {0, 1} that maps from\nthe input space to binary decisions; N labeled examples {xi , yi }N\ni=1 ; and a loss L\nevaluating performance (e.g., error).
