At the response layer, the wellknown Self-Consistency [2] strategy implicitly relies on comparisons between different responses. A variant, Soft SelfConsistency [75], calculates the joint probability of tokens for\neach response as the scoring function.\n\n11\n\nF. External Feedback\nSometimes, feedback from the model itself is not sufficient,\nand external feedback is needed. For example, in code generation, if there are hallucinations (bugs) in the code, it is difficult\nfor even humans to accurately identify some bugs without\nexecuting the code with an external executor. Self-Debug [76]\nproposes using the execution results from an external executor\nas feedback. Besides using external tools, some works use\nother models as external feedback sources, such as a more\npowerful teacher model [77] or a peer model [73]. The\ncommonly used RAG method, which can incorporates information retrieved from external sources as external feedback, is\nanother example. However, as mentioned in Section I-E, using\nexternal information sources is not the focus of this paper as it\ndoes not pertain to Internal Consistency Mining. Nevertheless,\nmany studies employing external signals in Self-Feedback are\nsummarized in Section VII.\nV.
