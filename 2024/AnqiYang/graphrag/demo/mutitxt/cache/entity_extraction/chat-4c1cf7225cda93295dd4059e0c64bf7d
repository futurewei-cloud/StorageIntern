Nonetheless,\nthese efforts lack a unified perspective on summarization, as\nexisting surveys predominantly focus on categorization without\nexamining the motivations behind these works.\nIn this paper, we summarize a theoretical framework, termed\nInternal Consistency, which offers unified explanations for\nphenomena such as the lack of reasoning and the presence\nof hallucinations. Internal Consistency assesses the coherence\namong LLMs\u2019 latent layer, decoding layer, and response layer\nbased on sampling methodologies. Expanding upon the Internal\nConsistency framework, we introduce a streamlined yet effective\ntheoretical framework capable of mining Internal Consistency,\nnamed Self-Feedback. The Self-Feedback framework consists\nof two modules: Self-Evaluation and Self-Update. The former\ncaptures Internal Consistency signals, while the latter leverages\nthe signals to enhance either the model\u2019s response or the model\nitself. This framework has been employed in numerous studies.\nWe systematically classify these studies by tasks and lines\nof work; summarize relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks; and delve into the concern, \u201cDoes Self-Feedback Really\nWork?\u201d We propose several critical viewpoints, including the\n\u201cHourglass Evolution of Internal Consistency\u201d, \u201cConsistency Is\n(Almost) Correctness\u201d hypothesis, and \u201cThe Paradox of Latent\nand Explicit Reasoning\u201d. Furthermore, we outline promising\ndirections for future research.
