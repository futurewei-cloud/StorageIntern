We consider two settings reflecting different levels of\ndifficulty in ranking concepts, showing that DEPICT generates better rankings\ncompared to baselines.\nTarget models. We consider two sets of scene classifiers. For all target models,\nwe learn a concept bottleneck g(x) \u2208 Rc where c is 15 concepts that the classifier\nmay rely on (see supplementary 9 for full list). Then, we learn a linear classifier\nf (g(x)) parameterized by w to map concepts to a final prediction. We train two\nsets of target classifiers:\nPrimary feature models. We first train binary tasks to classify images as\n{home or hotel} or {not}. By design, these models each rely heavily on one of\n15 concepts in the image: we resampled the training data such that there was a\n1:1 correlation between a concept in the image (e.g., person or couch) and the\noutcome, totalling 15 classifiers (full list in supplementary 9).\nMixed feature models. We also trained six scene classification tasks, where\na model classifies if an image is one of six scenes: (1) shopping and dining,\n(2) workplace, (3) home or hotel, (4) transportation, (5) cultural, and (6)\nsports and leisure.
