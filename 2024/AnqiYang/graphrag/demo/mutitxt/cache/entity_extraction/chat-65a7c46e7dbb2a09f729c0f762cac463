Understanding these causes can help researchers better address this\nissue and improve model performance.\nE. How to Understand Internal Consistency?\nThis section adopts a broader perspective, an alignment perspective, to help readers understand Internal Consistency. If\nthere is Internal Consistency, there must also be corresponding\nExternal Consistency. Internal Consistency focuses on whether\nthe model can align with itself during expression. External\nConsistency includes the alignment between the pre-training\ndataset and the pre-training model parameters, the alignment\nbetween the pre-trained model and the chat model, and the\nalignment between the chat model and the model subjected\nto RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback),\namong others. These different alignments can be illustrated in\nFig. 6. Each stage of alignment plays a unique role. Internal\nConsistency is crucial for AI safety. Kadavath et al. [42]\nmention the significant value of Internal Consistency:\n\u2022 Truthfulness. LLMs should provide factually accurate\ninformation, including finding, using, and evaluating\nsource materials correctly.\n\u2022 Calibration. LLMs\u2019 probabilistic predictions should correspond with frequencies of occurrence.\n10 Mode collapse: A generative model starts producing very similar or\nrepetitive outputs during training, failing to capture the diversity of the data.\n11 Neural collapse: The model learns the simplest representation to map\ninput to output, without capturing the complex logic within the data.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF LATEX\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
