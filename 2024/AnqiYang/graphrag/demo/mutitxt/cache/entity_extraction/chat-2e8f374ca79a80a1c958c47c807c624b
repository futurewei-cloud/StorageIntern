For\nexample, Zhang et al. [17] proposed a method named RATT\nto enhance the reasoning ability but used the hallucination\nevaluation benchmark TruthfulQA [16] in the experiments.\nSimilarly, Zhang et al. [7] focused on exploring methods\nto reduce hallucinations but employed the TriviaQA benchmark [18], supposedly to \u201ctest the model\u2019s reasoning ability\u201d.\nThese instances underscore the confusion in the development\nof this field caused by the misuse of terminology.\nTherefore, a unified perspective is required to analyze\nthese two similar phenomena. We adopt \u201cInternal Consistency\nMining\u201d as a term to encompass methods aimed at \u201creasoning\nelevation\u201d and \u201challucination alleviation\u201d. Indeed, LLMs don\u2019t\ncomprehend reasoning or hallucinations; they only predict the\nnext token based on probabilistic principles.\nB. Self-Feedback to Promote Internal Consistency\nTo enhance the model\u2019s internal consistency, scaling the\nmodel\u2019s parameters is the most direct approach [19]. However,\nthis doesn\u2019t address the fundamental problem of weak consistency, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, small language models\nprovide distinct advantages, including lower computational\ncosts and edge-side availability [20]. This indicates that while\nstudying scaling models, it is also crucial to explore strategies\nfor maximizing the capabilities given a small language model.\nNumer\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
