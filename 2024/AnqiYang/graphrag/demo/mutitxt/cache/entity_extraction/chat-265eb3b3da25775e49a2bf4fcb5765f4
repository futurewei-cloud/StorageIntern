Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

However,\nthis doesn\u2019t address the fundamental problem of weak consistency, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, small language models\nprovide distinct advantages, including lower computational\ncosts and edge-side availability [20]. This indicates that while\nstudying scaling models, it is also crucial to explore strategies\nfor maximizing the capabilities given a small language model.\nNumerous initiatives have been undertaken to improve the\nInternal Consistency of models. A pivotal approach involves\nmimicking human thought processes, which enables models to\nself-evaluate their own outputs and self-update their structure\n\n\fJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n\n3\n\nTABLE II\nS TRONGLY R ELATED S URVEYS\nSurvey\n\nTarget\n\nFramework Modules\n\nFeedback Form\n\nDepth\n\nSelf-Evolution\n[22]\n\nInstruction Following\u2191, Reasoning\u2191; Math\u2191; Code\nGenerating\u2191; Role-Play\u2191; Planning\u2191; Tool Using\u2191\n\nExperience Acquisition; Experience Refinement; Updating; Evaluation\n\nTextual; Scalar; External\n\nResponse\n\nSelf-Correction\n[23]\n\nHallucination\u2193; Unfaithful Reasoning\u2193; Toxic, Biased and Harmful Content\u2193\n\nLanguage Model (Patient); Critic Model\n(Doctor); Refine Model (\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
