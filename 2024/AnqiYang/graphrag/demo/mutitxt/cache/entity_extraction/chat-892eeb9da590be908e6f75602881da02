Additionally, we use the PlotQA dataset [42] where images generally lack numerical\nvalue annotations, necessitating value inference relative to the Y-axis. For evaluating the models\u2019\ncapability to capture global concepts, we assess on the Chart-to-Text task using the Pew and Statista\nsplits from the dataset [27]. The Pew split contains 9k images accompanied by descriptions written\nby professional editors, while the Statista split includes 33k images that often feature descriptive text\nwithin the charts themselves, making it an easier split than Pew.\nMetrics For ChartQA and PlotQA, we adopt the relaxed accuracy metric for numeric answers,\nallowing a 5% margin of error from the exact value, and use exact match for non-numeric answers as\nper the standard in previous studies [22, 37]. In the Chart-to-Table task, we measure performance\nusing F1 score of Relative Mapping Similarity (RMS) and Relative Number Set Similarity (RNSS)\nto evaluate numeric accuracy and table similarity, respectively. For the Chart-to-Text task, we use\nBLEU-4, an N-gram matching score, following the previous work [27].\nA 3-stage training process Unlike previous approaches that convert a general MLLM into a\nchart-specific expert by only applying LoRA fine-tuning on limited high-quality data [22], training\nC HOP\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
