The\nsubstantial performance improvement indicates that our model is adept at inferring data directly from\ncharts and demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we explore the impact of fundamental training strategies in adapting generalist Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to chart understanding. We offer practical guidance for\noptimizing feature alignment pre-training and end-to-end fine-tuning. Leveraging these enhanced\ntraining strategies, we introduce a specialized chart MLLM, named C HOPIN LLM, capable of interpreting diverse chart types independently of numerical annotations. Extensive experiments confirm\nthat C HOPIN LLM surpasses the previous state-of-the-art across four benchmarks, validating our\nframework\u2019s effectiveness. Additionally, we present a new benchmark specifically designed to\nevaluate MLLMs\u2019 comprehension across various chart types and multiple levels of understanding.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was funded, in part, by the Vector Institute for AI, Canada CIFAR AI Chairs, NSERC\nCRC, and NSERC DGs.
