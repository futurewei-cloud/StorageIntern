In SelfFeedback, the initial step is Self-Evaluation. The model can\nevaluate its own response, token probability distribution, or the\nlatent states. Through Self-Evaluation, different consistency\nsignals can be obtained: scalar signals (e.g., the confidence\nlevel of the output), textual signals (e.g., the model\u2019s critique\nof its own output), external signals (e.g., results from a Python\ninterpreter), and comparative signals (e.g., different token\nprobability distributions induced by two different prompts).\nThese signals are then used for downstream Self-Update,\nwith three typical update strategies.
