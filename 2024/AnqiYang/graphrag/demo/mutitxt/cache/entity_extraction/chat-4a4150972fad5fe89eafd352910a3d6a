These studies generally utilize visual instruction\ntuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy\nwithin the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy\nbetween natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data,\nparticularly in the models\u2019 capacity to extract underlying numeric values from\ncharts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs\u2019 comprehension of charts. We present three key findings:\n(1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves\ncomprehension of chart data.
