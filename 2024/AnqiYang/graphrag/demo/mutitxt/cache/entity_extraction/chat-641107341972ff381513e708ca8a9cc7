Most of the images in ChartQA [37] are annotated,\nwhich means the numerical values of data points are explicitly shown on the images. We observe that\nexisting chart MLLMs, such as ChartLlama [22], seem to heavily rely on this annotation for chart\nunderstanding, which is not ideal since real-world charts may be unannotated. We further evaluate\nthem using the PlotQA dataset, and the results are shown in the last column of Table 3. Notably,\nsince training previous models like ChartLlama on PlotQA is infeasible, we load the model weights\nas used in ChartQA and perform zero-shot prediction on PlotQA.
