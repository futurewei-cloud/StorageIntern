The methods discussed in this\nsection typically require searching the thought graph, necessitating evaluators to determine the usefulness of thoughts and\nwhether they merit further exploration. These works generally\nuse three approaches: Majority Voting, selecting the most\nconsistent response among multiple thoughts [2]; Rule-based\nmethods, designing specific scoring functions based on the\nproblem, such as error scoring functions in sorting tasks, representing the number of inversions and frequency differences\nbefore and after sorting [45]; and LLM-based methods, like\nthe scoring function in the Game of 24 task, where LLMs rate\nthe solution\u2019s feasibility as \u201csure/maybe/impossible\u201d [44].\nSelf-Update Strategy.
