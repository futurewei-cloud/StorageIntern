To our knowledge, surveys such as [22],\n[23], and [24] demonstrate substantial similarities to our work.\nWe present a straightforward comparison in Table II.\nA Survey on Self-Evolution of Large Language Models [22]\nprimarily focuses on two aspects of literature. It covers articles\non LLMs generating their own training data and papers\nemploying multi-agent approaches for iterative optimization.\nCompared to other studies, this study is the most comprehensive in content. As shown in Table II, the methods summarized\nin this survey encompass various tasks, including Instruction\nFollowing, Code Generation, and Planning. Given the wide\nrange of tasks covered, the objectives of Self-Evolution proposed in this survey may lack a clear focus.\nAutomatically Correcting Large Language Models: Surveying the Landscape of Diverse Automated Correction Strategies [23] specifically concentrates on Self-Correction, a process where models correct their own errors. Defined tasks\nencompass reasoning errors and harmful information. Owing\nto its explicit task definition, this survey offers a more detailed and comprehensive theoretical analysis. These tasks are\nclassified based on the timing of correction, including trainingtime, generation-time, and post-hoc corrections. Although the\nclassification approach is logical, it doesn\u2019t provide a comprehensive overview related to latent layers.
